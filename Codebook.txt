Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project CodeBook

This file describes variables, data and any transformations performed to clean up the data.

Data for assignment is downloaded from site following
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Download zip file on my computer and save it in a folder
Extracted the zipped data

Launch R Studio, set working directory using setwd() to folder where data was unzipped 

run_analysis.R script is created in the same directory

read activity_labels.txt file into data frame activityLabels
give meaningful column names to activityLabels df (data frame)

read features.txt file into features df
give meaningful column names to features df 

from test sub directory, read 3 files. set stringsAs Factors as FALSE so that all strings are not converted into factors
1. x_test.txt into xTest df # represents actual data
2. y_test.txt into yTest df # represents activity
3. subject_test.txt into subTest df # represents subject

combine columns of above 3 df into one df TestData
rename columns of TestData df to meaningful names like subject, activity, featuresnames of features df

set subject and activity as factorial
set levels of activity factorial


Perform similar steps for train data
and create TrainData

rowbind TestData and TrainData into a single dataframe 'data'

since column names contain invalid characters, get it removed using make.names func
remove all dots from col names
set col names of data df.

convert data df to tbl_df after loading dplyr package

select columns where name contain mean and std in it and store data in subdata

group by data based on subject and activity, and calculate mean for all columns
and store data in finaldata

save finaldata into a file.
